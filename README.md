# Final-Project_CS50
My final project for the CS50 course.
A web game build of the flask framework called Bulls and Cows centered around guessing words.
The web server connection to the clients is facilitated via flask-socketio.
For resetting password via email I've used the jwt security token.
For the front-end I've implemented a bit from the Bootstrap framework.
